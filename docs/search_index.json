This book documents the geodata and processing workflows used to create ecogeographical variables (EGVs) for species distribution modelling in Latvia (2024). This material has been developed to present the results of three projects implemented at the University of Latvia, which are deeply rooted in species distribution modeling, and, more importantly, to demonstrate and explain the work process and decisions made in order to ensure their repeatability and reproducibility. These projects are: The project “Preparation of a geospatial data layer covering existing protected areas for the implementation of the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030” (No. 1-08/73/2023), funded by the Latvian Environmental Protection Fund Administration ; Scientific research service project commissioned by AS “Latvijas valsts meži” (Latvian State Forests) “Improvement of the monitoring of the northern goshawk Accipiter gentilis and creation of a spatial model of habitat suitability” (Latvian State Forests document No. 5-5.5.1_000r_101_23_27_6); State research program “Development of research specified in the Biodiversity Priority Action Program” project “High-resolution quantification of biodiversity for nature conservation and management: HiQBioDiv” (VPP-VARAM-DABA-2024/1-0002). The material was developed in R using {bookdown}. The data processing and analysis described in the content was mainly performed in R, and one of the main reasons for creating this material was to transfer the information necessary for reproducing the work using verified command lines. A desirable side effect is to promote openness and reproducibility in scientific practice and practical science. Repo: aavotins/HiQBioDiv_EGVs Cite as needed using book/book.bib. About this material This material is not: an introduction to R or other programming languages. On the contrary, it will be most useful to those who already understand how to use command lines. However, it will also be informative for other users regarding the approaches used; a tutorial on geoprocessing. This material summarizes the approaches that, at the time of its development, were known to the authors as the most effective (in terms of processing time, RAM and hard disk space, performance guarantees, and reliability), but they are certainly not the only ones possible; copy/paste ready product. Although the use and publication of command lines tends to be intended for these purposes, in a situation where large amounts of data and, at least in part, restricted access data are used for the work, this is simply not possible. However, by ensuring data availability and placement in accordance with the file structure of this project (availabe at root/Data or by forking template repository), the command lines will be repeatable without changes and will produce the same results. This material has been prepared to provide a reproducible workflow, describing the decisions made and solutions implemented in the preparation of ecogeographical variables for species distribution (habitat suitability) modeling for biodiversity conservation planning. To a lesser extent, it also serves to demonstrate the results and ensure their accessibility. For the most part, this material consists of: explanatory text, which is recognizable as text; command lines, which are hidden by default to make the text easier to read. The locations of the command lines can be identified by the “|&gt; Code” visible on the left side of the page, just below this paragraph. Clicking on it will open the code area, where the text on a gray background is command lines, for example: Code object=function(arguments1,arguments2, path=&quot;./path/file/tree/object.extension&quot;) # comment In the example above, the first line creates an object (“object”) that is the result of a function (“function()”). The function has three arguments (“arguments1”, “arguments2” and “path”) separated by commas (as with all function arguments in R). The third argument is the path in the file tree (it is on a new line but is a continuation of the function on the previous line, because the parentheses are not closed), which is indicated by an equal sign (and quotation marks) followed by this path (note the beginning “./”, which indicates a relative path - the location in the file tree is relative to the project location). The second line of the example above is a comment - everything after “#” is a comment. Anything in a command line before “#” must be an executable function or object. A comment can contain anything and be on the same line as an executable function (at the end of it). Command lines are the most important part of this material for reproducibility. However, the person using them must ensure the availability of input data and maintain correct paths in the file tree. Command lines can also be found in text, for example, # comment as a command line in text. Sometimes I will refer to R packages in the text, I will put them in curly brackets, for example, {package}. graphics - various diagrams that describe the workflow or data characteristics; links to other resources, especially to higher-level products and results created within the project, but also to input data, if it is publicly available. The results are intended for practical use. Within reason, the material describes all data sets used and provides metadata related to ensuring reproducibility. Since not all data sets are freely available, they are not published as such, but in all cases information is provided on how they were obtained for the development of this project. Outline Terminology and acronyms Utilities Template files Raw geodata Geodata products Ecogeographical variables Data accessibility "],["Ch01.html", "1 Terminology and acronyms", " 1 Terminology and acronyms Even though every data that are or can be georeferenced may be considered geodata, in this material we try to seperately use following terms in their particular order in our workflows: raw geodata - considered raw data as obtained for harmonized description of the environment. It may be tables with coordinates, raster of vector data. Literally anything that can or has been used for creation of ecogeographical variables without or with only slight processing. geodata product - processed raw geodata that needed heavy modifications, e.g.  spatial overlayrs and combinations of different sets of raw geodata to be used as input data. In this document geodata products are categorical raster layers matching CRS and pixel locations of input data. When splitted by categories, they become input data. The processing step of creating geodata products is necessary when decidions of spatial overlay order are important, e.g. in one high resolution pixel there can be only water or forest, if the edge between water and forest need to be calculated. input data or input layers - very-high resolution (multiple from the one used for ecogeographical variables) raster data, that are direct input in creation of most of the ecogeographical variables. Creation of such layers ir particularly useful in line with geodata products as dealing with border misalignment or decissions of order of spatial overlay as well as simple geoprocessing is much faster with raster data. ecogeographical variables (EGVs) - this is the final product of the workflow describing environment for statistical analysis (e.g. species distribution modelling) and is suitable for publishing due to standadisation of the values. In other terms, these are standardised landscape ecological variables as high-resolution (we use 1 ha cells) raster layers. Each layer contains values representing environment within the cells footprint or a summary of focal neighbours. In our case every layer is of quantitative data, describing natural quantity (i.e., timber volume in the analysis cell, mean annual temperature), or quantified information of categories (e.g., fraction of class area at analysis cell or some neighbourhood, number of pixels creating an edge of some class or between two classes in the analysis cell or some neighbourhood). Each layers values are standardised - from every cells value layers mean is subtracted and then every cells value is divided by layers root mean square error. Therefore the values are more suitable for modelling and layers can be made publically available as they directly do not provide exact sensitive information. In this material we use species ditribution modelling as a more used term, that is synonymous to ecological niche analysis and ecological niche modelling.
