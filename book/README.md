Welcome! 

This book documents the geodata and processing workflows used to create
ecogeographical variables (EGVs) for species distribution modelling in Latvia (2024).

This material has been developed to present the results of three projects 
implemented at the University of Latvia, which are deeply rooted in 
species distribution modeling, and, more importantly, to demonstrate and explain 
the work process and decisions made in order to ensure their repeatability and 
reproducibility. These projects are:

- The project "Preparation of a geospatial data layer covering existing 
protected areas for the implementation of the EU Biodiversity Strategy 
2030" (No. 1-08/73/2023), funded by the Latvian Environmental 
Protection Fund Administration;

- Scientific research service project commissioned by AS "Latvijas valsts 
me≈æi" (Latvian State Forests) "Improvement of the monitoring of the northern 
goshawk *Accipiter gentilis* and creation of a spatial model of habitat 
suitability" (Latvian State Forests document No. 5-5.5.1_000r_101_23_27_6);

- most importantly **State research program "Development of research specified in the Biodiversity 
Priority Action Program" project "High-resolution quantification of biodiversity 
for nature conservation and management: HiQBioDiv" (VPP-VARAM-DABA-2024/1-0002)**.

The material was developed in R using {bookdown}. The data processing and analysis 
described in the content was mainly performed in R, and one of the main reasons for 
creating this material was to transfer the information necessary for reproducing the 
work using verified command lines. A desirable side effect is to promote openness and 
reproducibility in scientific practice and practical science.
